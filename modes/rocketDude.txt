	"Description"		"RocketDude is a coop mutation that allows up to 4 players, but without any survivor bots. The player begins with 200 max health and is equipped with a grenade launcher and either a random sharp melee weapon or a magnum. The grenade launcher is able to catapult any physics props and players far beyond the stratosphere. Just take care not to send a car flying towards you."
